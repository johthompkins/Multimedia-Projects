Project3 is a on your own project. We got to take all that we learn and put it to good use. I ended up creating a webpage that can help people read and understand words that they might not know. I used APIs to have text to speech. I also was able to control the speed, accent, and play/stop. Defining words is a simple hyper link to dictionary.com where it will tell you what the word means.
